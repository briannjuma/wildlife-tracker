## Project Description
A java/spark web application that enables Rangers to track wildlife sightings in their area. Following 
a proposal by a timber company to clear-cut the nearby forest of Douglas Fir, this application
comes in as a digital tool to aid in an environmental impact study run by the Forest Service through
its rangers to report on the animal population sighted in the affected area.Using this platform
the Forest Rangers will be able to record and report animal sightings in that area in realtime 
therefore producing critical data that should contribute to the final decision by the Forest Authority.
